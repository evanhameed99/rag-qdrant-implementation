    "abstract": "ZooKeeper is a crash-tolerant system that offers fundamental services to Internet-scale applications, thereby reducing the development and hosting of the latter. It consists of N ≥ 3 servers that form a replicated state machine. Maintaining these replicas in a mutually consistent state requires executing an Atomic Broadcast Protocol, Zab, so that concurrent requests for state changes are serialised identically at all replicas before being acted upon. Thus, ZooKeeper performance for update operations is determined by Zab performance. We contribute by presenting two easy-to-implement Zab variants, called ZabAC and ZabAA. They are designed to offer small atomic-broadcast latencies and to reduce the processing load on the primary node that plays a leading role in Zab. The former improves ZooKeeper performance and the latter enables ZooKeeper to face more challenging load conditions. 1998 ACM Subject Classification D.2.8 Performance measures, D.4.7 Distributed systems"

    "title": "A Triangle Inequality for Cosine Similarity",
    "abstract": "Similarity search is a fundamental problem for many data analysis techniques.Many efficient search techniques rely on the triangle inequality of metrics,which allows pruning parts of the search space based on transitive bounds ondistances. Recently, Cosine similarity has become a popular alternative choiceto the standard Euclidean metric, in particular in the context of textual dataand neural network embeddings. Unfortunately, Cosine similarity is not metricand does not satisfy the standard triangle inequality. Instead, many searchtechniques for Cosine rely on approximation techniques such as localitysensitive hashing. In this paper, we derive a triangle inequality for Cosinesimilarity that is suitable for efficient similarity search with many standardsearch structures (such as the VP-tree, Cover-tree, and M-tree); show that thisbound is tight and discuss fast approximations for it. We hope that this spursnew research on accelerating exact similarity search for cosine similarity, andpossible other similarity measures beyond the existing work for distancemetrics."

    "title": "Testing microservice architectures for operational reliability",
    "abstract": "Summary Microservice architectures (MSA) is an emerging software architectural paradigm for service‐oriented applications, well‐suited for dynamic contexts requiring loosely coupled independent services, frequent software releases and decentralized governance. A key problem in the engineering of MSA applications is the estimate of their reliability, which is difficult to perform prior to release due frequent releases/service upgrades, dynamic service interactions, and changes in the way customers use the applications. This paper presents an in vivo testing method, named EMART, to faithfully assess the reliability of an MSA application in operation. EMART is based on an adaptive sampling strategy, leveraging monitoring data about microservices usage and failure/success of user demands. We present results of evaluation of estimation accuracy, confidence and efficiency, through a set of controlled experiments with publicly available subjects. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

    "title": "Bigorexia: bodybuilding and muscle dysmorphia",
    "abstract": "Abstract Muscle dysmorphia is an emerging condition that primarily affects male bodybuilders. Such individuals obsess about being inadequately muscular. Compulsions include spending hours in the gym, squandering excessive amounts of money on ineffectual sports supplements, abnormal eating patterns or even substance abuse. In this essay, I illustrate the features of muscle dysmorphia by employing the first‐person account of a male bodybuilder afflicted by this condition. I briefly outline the history of bodybuilding and examine whether the growth of this sport is linked to a growing concern with body image amongst males. I suggest that muscle dysmorphia may be a new expression of a common pathology shared with the eating disorders. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and Eating Disorders Association."

    "title": "Bodybuilding links to Upper Crossed Syndrome",
    "abstract": "Introduction: Upper cross syndrome is becoming more prevalent in today’s population. The syndrome is described as a postural disorder presenting with over active pectoralis musculature and upper trapezius musculature. Also there is inhibition of lower and middle trapezius musculature, which results in winging of scapula, elevated and abducted scapula. This scapular dyskinesia, per se, resulted in rounding of shoulders. The syndrome is often associated with bad posture in routine life or occupation of a person. Little is known about the relationship between sport participation and postural body changes of bodybuilding training. Our aim is to investigate whether bodybuilding training in trained-individuals is associated with the postural abnormalities in the upper body. Methods: 60 male, trained bodybuilders (age= 24.62±3.67 years, body weight= 82.40±9 kg, height= 175±0.067 cm, body mass index (BMI ( = 26.77±2.37 Kg/m2, body fat percentage = 21.58±3.21) and 30 un-trained (age= 24.67±2.24 years, body weight= 73.33±9.42 kg, height= 175±0.06 cm, body mass index (BMI) = 23.93±3.16 Kg/m2, body fat percentage = 18.17±3.76) volunteered and were thus included in the study. Postural photographs were taken in the sagittal and frontal planes, and were analyzed by using AutoCAD software. The Flexi curve ruler was used for the assessment of thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis. Results: Using an independent sample t-test, significant differences were observed in the values of forward head posture between trained and untrained groups (p=0.001) and Mann-Whitney U test showed there was significant differences between the values of uneven shoulders (p=0.001), rounded shoulder (p=0.009) and kyphosis (p=0.013), but there was no significant difference between lordosis values in two groups. Conclusion: It can be concluded that there is a high incidence of upper body abnormalities among bodybuilders and this should be taken as a minatory situation on behalf of bodybuilding trainers. Therefore, strength coaches should design an appropriate training program to prevent their trainees from such abnormalities."

    "title": "Untangling Blockchain: A Data Processing View of Blockchain Systems",
    "abstract": "Blockchain technologies are gaining massive momentum in the last few years. Blockchains are distributed ledgers that enable parties who do not fully trust each other to maintain a set of global states. The parties agree on the existence, values, and histories of the states. As the technology landscape is expanding rapidly, it is both important and challenging to have a firm grasp of what the core technologies have to offer, especially with respect to their data processing capabilities. In this paper, we first survey the state of the art, focusing on private blockchains (in which parties are authenticated). We analyze both in-production and research systems in four dimensions: distributed ledger, cryptography, consensus protocol, and smart contract. We then present BLOCKBENCH, a benchmarking framework for understanding performance of private blockchains against data processing workloads. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of three major blockchain systems based on BLOCKBENCH, namely Ethereum, Parity, and Hyperledger Fabric. The results demonstrate several trade-offs in the design space, as well as big performance gaps between blockchain and database systems. Drawing from design principles of database systems, we discuss several research directions for bringing blockchain performance closer to the realm of databases."

    "title": "Smart blockchain",
    "abstract": "Blockchain technology in Bitcoin is a decentralized, de-trusted, open and transparent distributed data storage technology that can reduce trust costs and achieve secure and reliable data interaction. However, an attacker can easily obtain all the Bitcoin transaction information from a public global ledger and use big-data analysis techniques to mine private information such as user transaction laws. Therefore, it is necessary to hide some of the transaction information in the public data. This paper presents a Bitcoin transaction information hiding algorithm based on HEVC without intra-frame distortion drift. We embed the specified transaction data into the three-tuple of the 4 4 luminance DST blocks which meet our conditions to avert the distortion drift. With the cross using of multiple three-tuple, the visual quality of the embedded video had a better promotion than using single three-tuple. The experimental results show that this new data hiding algorithm can effectively avert intra-frame distortion drift and get good visual quality."

    "title": "The role of software engineering",
    "abstract": "for avoiding many of the risks noted in earlier installments of Inside RISKS. We consider here potential benefits and realistic expectations. Developing systems that must satisfy multiple critical requirements such as reliability, security, human safety, and application correctness generally entails many risks. Minimizing the risks requires an extremely principled approach 1:o system development, well beyond what is traditionally experienced in general programming practice. This is especially true when system elements are highly dispersed, when control and accountability are distributed, and when the requirements are particularly stringent. We assume here a general familiarity with spiral development models, ongoing evaluations and reviews, and software engineering principles such as abstraction, encap-sulation, information hiding, strong typing, separation of mechanism in design, separation of duties in operation, allocation of least privilege, protected kernels, trusted computing bases, and client server architectures, to name a few. A compendium of several old ideas has reemerged under the popular rubric of the object-oriented paradigm, which combines four principles of software engineering-abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance. (Polymorphism is the notion that a computational resource can accept arguments of different types at different times, and still remain type-safe; it enhances programming generality and software reuse. Inheritance is the notion that related classes of objects behave similarly, and that sub-classes are; able to inherit the proper behavior of their ancestors; it enhances software reuse across related classes.) The question considered here is this: Might the consistent use of these principles help avoid disasters such as those pervading the RISKS archives relating to security, reliability, safety, and other requirements? • Security. When properly implemented, the object-oriented paradigm can help avoid trapdoors, exposures of internal information, and other bypasses of security. (Conversely , improper encapsulation, inheritance of unnecessary privileges, and inadequate enforcement of polymorphism are common sources of security flaws.) Separation of privileges laelps to avoid dependence on mechanisms such as Unix superuser and. rhosts (the latter permitting unauthen-ticated remote access), and limits the effects of intentional misbehavior. Most of the preceding principles can contribute to increased security and system integrity. valuabi-e for reliabilit); separating causes and effects, and isolating the consequences of accidental problems. • Safety. Human safety ultimately depends on dependable application software running on suitably reliable and secure < systems. It can benefit from good engineering practice, with respect to both the underlying subsystems and the application code. Abstraction and encapsulation can limit arbitrary application code's ability to violate safety requirements."

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Concern regarding the rising incidence of melanoma and non‐melanoma skin cancers in Malta has led to the organization of annual campaigns since the early 1990s. These aim to inform the public of the dangers of sun exposure and to promote sun protection. Objective  To help guide future campaigns, a survey was carried out to evaluate current sun protection measures among the Maltese people and to assess their level of knowledge regarding harmful effects of the sun on the skin. Study design  A total of 559 pedestrians were interviewed in the main street of the capital city of Malta in the summer of 1999. Results  Self‐reported rates of regular sunscreen and hat use in adults exposed to the spring/summer sun between 10.00 h and 15.00 h were 51% and 32%, respectively, for leisure activities, and 25% and 37%, respectively, for outdoor work. Men reported using sunscreen less often than women during both leisure and work. The fairer‐skinned outdoor workers actually reported making less use of a sunscreen and/or hat than their darker counterparts, and rates of sunscreen and/or hat use during leisure and work were not found to increase with the amount of time spent in the sun. Almost 75% of sunscreen users were using a sun protection factor of at least 15. Parents reported much higher rates of regular sunscreen and hat use by their young children than by themselves, with 87% of children under 12 years of age reported to be using sunscreen and 78% reported to be wearing a hat. The great majority knew that injudicious sun exposure is associated with skin cancer and skin ageing, but 48% were still regarding a suntan achieved without skin burning as ‘healthy’. The mass media was by far considered to be the main source of information for the general public regarding effects of the sun on the skin. Conclusions  The positive impact of past campaigns can be seen in the high reported rates of sun protection in children. However, much remains to be done with adults in order to change their attitude about a ‘healthy suntan’ and to convince them that it is worthwhile to protect themselves from the sun."

    "abstract": "Context. Monitoring of the photometric and chromospheric HK emission dataseries of stars similar to the Sun in age and average activity level showedthat there is an empirical correlation between the average stellarchromospheric activity level and the photometric variability. In general, moreactive stars show larger photometric variability. Interestingly, themeasurements and reconstructions of the solar irradiance show that the Sun issignificantly less variable than indicated by the empirical relationship. Aims.We aim to identify possible reasons for the Sun to be currently outside of thisrelationship. Methods. We employed different scenarios of solar HK emission andirradiance variability and compared them with available time series of Sun-likestars. Results. We show that the position of the Sun on the diagram ofphotometric variability versus chromospheric activity changes with time. Thepresent solar position is different from its temporal mean position as thesatellite era of continuous solar irradiance measurements has accidentallycoincided with a period of unusually high and stable solar activity. Ouranalysis suggests that although present solar variability is significantlysmaller than indicated by the stellar data, the temporal mean solar variabilitymight be in agreement with the stellar data. We propose that the continuationof the photometric program and its expansion to a larger stellar sample willultimately allow us to constrain the historical solar variability.Comment: 10 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy&Astrophysic"

Third-party coordination services such as <mark>ZooKeeper</mark> and Consul are fundamental building blocks for cloud applications, but are exposed to potentially sensitive application data. Recently, hardware trust mechanisms such as Intel’s Software Guard Extensions (SGX) offer trusted execution environments to shield application data from untrusted software, including the privileged Operating System (OS) and hypervisors. Such hardware support suggests new options for securing third-party coordination services.We describe SecureKeeper, an enhanced version of the <mark>ZooKeeper</mark> coordination service that uses SGX to preserve the confidentiality and basic integrity of <mark>ZooKeeper</mark>- managed data. SecureKeeper uses multiple small enclaves to ensure that (i) user-provided data in <mark>ZooKeeper</mark> is always kept encrypted while not residing inside an enclave, and (ii) essential processing steps that demand plaintext access can still be performed securely. SecureKeeper limits the required changes to the <mark>ZooKeeper</mark> code base and relies on Java’s native code support for accessing enclaves.

In a distributed asynchronous shared storage like <mark>ZooKeeper</mark>, watchers deliver notifications on state changes. They are difficult to test because watcher notifications involve an initial action that sets the watcher, followed by another action that changes the previously seen state.  We show how to generate test cases for concurrent client sessions executing against <mark>ZooKeeper</mark> with the tool Modbat. The tests are verified against an oracle that takes into account all possible timings of network communication. The oracle has to verify that there exists a chain of events that triggers both the initial callback and the subsequent watcher notification. We show in detail how the oracle computes whether watch triggers are correct and how the model was adapted and improved to handle these features. Together with a new search improvement that increases both speed and accuracy, we are able to verify large test setups and confirm several defects with our model."

A significantly lower occurrence of eating or drinking occurred when the <mark>zookeeper</mark> was inside the exhibit.

A statistically higher occurrence of vigilance toward the <mark>zookeeper</mark> was directed by female ungulates but not by males when the zoo was closed to the public.

Likewise, when data regarding interspecific vigilance were examined, statistically significant differences were found across size categories for females, but not for males.

    "abstract": "Operating at the core of the highly-available <mark>ZooKeeper</mark> system is the <mark>ZooKeeper</mark> atomic broadcast (Zab) for imposing a total order on service requests that seek to modify the replicated system state. Zab is designed with the weakest assumptions possible under crash-recovery fault model; e.g., any number even all of servers can crash simultaneously and the system will continue or resume its service provisioning when a server quorum remains or resumes to be operative. Our aim is to explore ways of improving Zab performance without modifying its easy-to-implement structure. To this end, we rst assume that server crashes are independent and a server quorum remains operative at all time. Under these restrictive, yet practical, assumptions, we propose three variations of Zab and do performance comparison. The rst variation o ers excellent performance but can be only used for 3-server systems; the other two do not have this limitation. One of them reduces the leader overhead further by conditioning the sending of acknowledgements on the outcomes of coin tosses. Owing to its superb performance, it is re-designed to operate under the least-restricted Zab fault assumptions. Further performance comparisons con rm the potential of coin-tossing in o ering performances better than Zab, particularly at high workloads.

We assessed student performance to evaluate if the <mark>laptops</mark> helped improve student learning. Although not a perfectly controlled experiment (i.e., the student groups were different), the two sections were uniform in terms of course content and assignments. Because of their inherently large standard deviations, class metrics (grades) are not conclusive, but they do indicate that the laptop students performed slightly better than the non‐laptop students, even though their composite grade point average entering the course was lower. Evaluations do clearly show that, when the technology is used properly and when class time is not spent resolving technical problems, the laptop students had a more positive learning experience."

    "abstract": "This Point/Counterpoint article discusses the pros and cons of deploying one aspect of instructional technology in dental education: the use of <mark>laptops</mark> in the classroom. Two opposing viewpoints, written by different authors, evaluate the arguments. Viewpoint 1 argues that <mark>laptops</mark> in classrooms can be a catalyst for rapid curricular advancement and prepare dental graduates for the digital age of dentistry. As dental education is not limited to textual information, but includes skill development in spatial relationships and hands‐on training, technology can play a transformative role in students’ learning. Carefully implemented instructional technology can enhance student motivation when it transforms students from being the  objects  of teaching to the  subjects  of learning. Ubiquitous access to educational material allows for just‐in‐time learning and can overcome organizational barriers when, for instance, introducing interprofessional education. Viewpoint 2 argues that, in spite of widespread agreement that instructional technology leads to curricular innovation, the notion of the use of <mark>laptops</mark> in classrooms needs to be deconstructed and rethought when effective learning outcomes are sought. Analyzing the purpose, pedagogy, and learning product while applying lessons learned from K‐12 implementation leads to a more complex picture of laptop integration in dental classrooms and forms the basis for questioning the value of such usage. For laptop use to contribute to student learning, rather than simply providing opportunity for students to take notes and access the Internet during class, this viewpoint emphasizes that dental educators need to think carefully about the purpose of this technology and to develop appropriate pedagogical strategies to achieve their objectives. The two viewpoints agree that significant faculty development efforts should precede any introduction of technology into the educational process and that technology alone cannot change education. While the first viewpoint emphasizes the pivotal role of technology in bringing dental education into the contemporary digital world, the second viewpoint focuses on challenges surrounding laptop usage in the classroom including the alignment of instructional methods with learning objectives."
